With the ability to grasp the bigger picture, or zoom in to the smallest detail, I love working with a cross-functional team to help create powerful software, setting the standard that softwareâ€”and websitesâ€”should be easy to use and accessible to as many people as possible.",

I pride myself in my problem solving, attention to detail, efficiency, and my ability to communicate technical subjects to less technical people.",
			"I was once described as the glue that brought the team together and I like to help my team whenever I can. I have extensive experience with team supervision and review, including designs, code, and usability. I also love to create libraries and tools, ensuring the highest standards and consistency for everyone to work from."
